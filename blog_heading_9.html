                        <h2>Meet Suresh Nair, the BHU prof who's getting students to spread the message of peace through art </h2>

                        <p>From the very beginning of his career as an artist, Suresh K Nair has been writing peaceful love letters to the world, sprawled across the walls of Kerala and outside it. Having grown up in  Palakkad’s Vellinezhi region, the state’s first and only artist village, his tryst with art was, in the simplest sense, quite inevitable. And through his decades of work in the industry, he has managed to expand the world’s canvas through his own work and as a professor of painting at Banaras Hindu University.</p>
                        <p>Thousands of artists are born in Vellinezhi where they dabble in over 50 genres of performance and visual art. Nair’s own journey as a painter began with murals. The village has two main temples where he drew his first murals. He would also draw illustrations for publications like Mathrubhumi. In five years, he obtained a diploma in mural painting from the Institute of Mural Painting in Guruvayoor.</p>
<p> After spending the early 2000s traveling through Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, he started to wonder if he was losing his way. He says, “Usually, artists are always faced wth a moment where commercialisation looks them in the face and they have to make a choice. I did not want to fall prey to it. So I studied at Visva Bharati University in Kolkata for 5 years and got a Canadian fellowship. Here, I was exposed to a larger world of art from our own country and outside it.”

After a brief stint at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in Kalady and being selected for the Fulbright Scholarship in the US, he started working at Banaras Hindu University among the Faculty of Visual Art. “When I joined in 2007, Banaras, one of the oldest and most beautiful Indian cities, was also one of the dirtiest. Inspired by my work outside the country, I created Project Mural City with my students in an attempt to clean it up and beautify it further.”</p>                     </div>

                    <p class="excert"><i><b>Wall of Peace</b></i></p>
                    <p>In January, 2019, Suresh and his students at BHU embarked on one of the greatest community art projects the country has seen. On the wall of the Government Vocational Higher Secondary School in Cherpulassery, Kerala, they recreated the peaceful history that the region was famous for through murals. Spanning across 7000 square feet and divided into 25 panels, the wall tells the story of Mozhikunnath Brahmadattan Namboodiripad, a leader of the 1921 Malabar Rebellion, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Gandhi in conversation with the people of Cherpulassery and various others.

Suresh says, “What we had created was the first of its kind. And the portraits we painted were a memory of the great history and tradition that Cherupulassery had. We have designed it through various panels, each of which tell a different story.” The artist credits the people of Cherpulassery for helping him recreate their history on the school’s walls.  </p>
